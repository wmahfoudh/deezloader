# deezloader

This is a fork of the original project located here https://github.com/An0nimia/deezloader

# Changes
- The way files are saved is amatter of taste. This fork is a minor change of the original project for improving the way files are saved: Instaed of individual folders for each file, files are saved in the same folder given in the command line with the following pattern [track name] - [artist]. File names are sanitized before saving
- This repository won't probably be updated, the reason why I am truncating the original README file. Please go to the master project for the most updated version and instructions
